<h2><span class="smcap">Introduction.</span></h2>


<p>It is certainly somewhat curious that, in a county
so confessedly rich in ballads and in popular
songs as Derbyshire is, no attempt should hitherto
have been made to collect together and give to the world
even a small selection of these valuable and interesting
remains. Such, however, is the fact, and the ballads, the
traditions, and the lyrics of the county have remained to
the present day uncollected, and, it is to be feared, uncared
for, by those to whom the task of collection in days gone
by would have been tolerably easy. It has therefore remained
for me, with my present volume, to initiate a series
of works which shall embrace these and kindred subjects,
and vindicate for Derbyshire its place in the literary history
of the kingdom.</p>

<p>In my present volume I have given a selection of upwards
of fifty ballads and songs, many of them extremely
curious, and all highly interesting, which are purely Derbyshire,
and relate entirely to that county, to events which
have happened within its bounds, or to Derbyshire families.
These I have collected together from every available
source, and several amongst them have never before been
reprinted from the old broad-sheets and garlands in which
they are contained; while others, taken down from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
lips of "old inhabitants," or from the original MSS., are for
the first-time put into type. Knowing that in ballads it is
next to, if not quite, impossible to accomplish a successful
chronological arrangement, and feeling that, if accomplished,
such an arrangement is open to grave objections,
I have purposely avoided the attempt, and have contented
myself with varying, as much as possible, the contents of
my volume, and with giving to each ballad an introductory
notice touching on the event commemorated, on the writer
of the piece, or on the source from whence the ballad has
been obtained. Having done this, the necessity for a long
introduction here is obviated, and it only remains for me
to announce my intention of following up my present
volume with another similar one, as a "Second Series" of
Derbyshire Ballads and Songs, and with others on the
Poets and Poetry of Derbyshire; on the Political and
Criminal songs of the county; and on its Folk-Lore and
Traditions, etc. It is hoped that the present volume will find
sufficient favour with the public to act as an encouragement
to the early issue of the succeeding volumes, which will
contain a vast amount of interesting and valuable information
on points about which at present but little is known.</p>

<p>It will be seen that in the introductory notices to the
ballads in the following pages I have acknowledged my
obligations to various kind friends for the assistance they
have rendered. I have now only in general terms to again
tender them my thanks, and, in so doing, to ask them, and
all who can in any way assist me in my labours, to continue
their kind help to my future volumes, and so enable me to
do justice to the rich and beautiful county which it has
been my life-long study to illustrate.</p>

<p>As a frontispiece to my present volume, I give a fac-simile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
of an old portrait of a Derbyshire ballad-singer of
the last century, "<i>Singing Sam of Derbyshire</i>" as he was
called, which I copy from the curious plate etched by W.
Williams in 1760, which appeared in the "Topographer"
thirty years after that time. The man was a singular
character&mdash;a wandering minstrel who got his living by
singing ballads in the Peak villages, and accompanying
himself on his rude single-stringed instrument. Doubtless
"The Beggar's Ramble" and "The Beggar's Wells," and
other similar rhymes, were the production of "Singing
Sam" or his compeers, and recounted his own peregrinations
through the country. His instrument was as quaint
and curious as himself. It consisted of a straight staff
nearly as tall as himself, with a single string tied fast around
it at each end. This he tightened with a fully inflated
cow's bladder, which assisted very materially the tone of
the rude instrument. His bow was a rough stick of hazel
or briar, with a single string; and with this, with the lower
end of his staff resting on the ground, and the upper
grasped by his right hand, which he passed up and down to
tighten or slacken the string as he played, he scraped away,
and produced sounds which, though not so musical as those
of Paganini and <i>his</i> single string, would no doubt harmonize
with Sam's rude ballad, and ruder voice. This portrait I
believe has never been reproduced until now.</p>

<p>On the title-page I give a small vignette showing a ballad
singer of an earlier date, from a sketch by Inigo Jones,
made two hundred and thirty years ago, which belongs to
His Grace the Duke of Devonshire. Unlike "Singing Sam
of Derbyshire," who sang his ballads from memory, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
probably composed many of them as he went on, so as to
suit the localities and the tastes and habits of his hearers,
the man here shown sings from a printed broad-sheet, of
which he carries an armful with him to dispose of to such
as cared to purchase them. He is literally a "running
stationer," "such as use to sing ballads and cry malignant
pamphlets in the streets," and indulged their hearers in
town and country with "fond bookes, ballads, rhimes, and
other lewd treatises in the English tongue."</p>

<p>In my next volume I shall give a portrait of "Hale the
Piper," another Derbyshire "worthy," and shall then take
occasion to speak of the origin of Hornpipes in the locality
which gave him birth.</p>

<h1>DERBYSHIRE BALLADS.</h1>

<hr class="chap" />



<h2><i>King Henry V.</i>,<br />

<small><i>His Conquest of France, in Revenge for the Affront
offered by the French King, in sending him (instead
of the Tribute) a Ton of Tennis-balls.</i></small></h2>


<p>This is one of the most curious and popular of the series of
Derbyshire ballads, and one which, in its early broad-sheet
form, is of great rarity. The broad-sheet from which it is
here reprinted, is "Printed and Sold in Aldermary Church Yard, Bow
Lane, London." It is printed broad-way of the sheet, with two short
columns of three verses each beneath the engraving, and one whole
column of eight verses at the side. The engraving represents a fortification,
with central tower, with the Union Jack flying; the sea in
front, with a ship and some small boats; and two tall soldiers in mid-ground,
evidently "on guard." Versions of this ballad have been
printed by Mr. Dixon, in the volume on <i>Ancient Poems, Ballads, and
Songs of the Peasantry of England</i>, edited by him for the Percy Society,
and in other collections. Printed copies are to be found in the
Roxburghe Collection in the British Museum, and in the Halliwell
Collection in the Chetham Library, Manchester. The one here
given is from the original broad-sheet in my own collection.</p>

<p>The ballad will be at once seen to refer to the battle of Agincourt,
which was a prolific source of inspiration to the ballad and song writers
of the time, and of later years. Tradition bears out the noble feature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
of the ballad&mdash;that of no married man or widow's son being either
recruited or pressed into the service of the Sovereign over this expedition.
A tradition still obtains in the Peak, among the "hills that
are so free," that when Henry V. was recruiting Derbyshire and the
adjoining counties, he declared that he would take no married man,
and that no widow's son should be of his company, for no woman's
curse should go with him in his righteous expedition.</p>

<p>The ballad is still not unfrequently sung in snatches by the miners
and other hardy sons of the Peak, the verse being usually rendered:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No married man, nor no widow's son,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Will I ever ask to go with me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I will take no widow's curse<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From the Derby hills that are so free."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is said that on one occasion, when George III. was reviewing a
brigade of Guards in Hyde Park, he was particularly struck with the
fine stalwart and manly bearing of one of the regiments,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and calling
out to the nearest man in the ranks, asked, "Well, my fine fellow,
where are you from, eh?" "Derbyshire, please your Majesty," was
the reply. "Eh, Derbyshire eh! From Derby hills so free," rejoined
the King, showing that he must have been acquainted with the ballad

<p>The tune to which this Ballad was sung I here give. I am not
aware that it has ever before been printed. I remember hearing it
frequently sung when I was a boy, and the spirit with which it was
sung is still fresh in my memory. It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Another traditional version of the tune to which the ballad was
sung, and which, like the one just given, is common to it and to
"Robin Hood and the Pedlar," which begins&mdash;</p>

<h2><i>A Ballad of Darbyshire.</i><br />
<small>BY SIR ASTON COKAIN.</small></h2>


<p>Sir Aston Cokain, the most illustrious member of the famous
family of Cokain, of Ashborne, was the son of Thomas Cokain,
of Ashborne and of Pooley, by his wife Ann, daughter of Sir
John Stanhope,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of Elvaston, by Derby. He was born at Elvaston, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
1608, was educated at Cambridge, and received the honour of knighthood
in 1641. He was one of the most eminent poets of the day, and was
the intimate friend of Donne, Suckling, Randolph, Drayton, Massinger,
Habbington, Sandys, May, Jonson, and other wits of the age. He was
cousin to Charles Cotton, to whom he addressed many of his writings.
Sir Aston married Mary, daughter of Sir Gilbert Kniveton, of Mercaston,
near Derby. In 1671 he, with his son, Thomas Cokain, sold his
estates in the neighbourhood of Ashborne to Sir William Boothby; and
he also sold his estate of Pooley. In 1683 Sir Aston Cokain died at
Derby, and was buried at Polesworth. His son Thomas, who married
Mary, co-heiress of Carey Sherry, was the last male heir of the family,
and died without issue.</p>

<p>In 1658 Sir Aston Cokain published his volume, <i>Small Poems of
Divers Sorts</i>, a volume of 508 pages, which is now of great rarity.
Some few copies have a portrait&mdash;a laureated bust&mdash;of Cokain, with
the verse&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come, Reader, draw thy purse, and be a guest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To our Parnassus; 'Tis the Muses feast.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Appollo's th' Host where Cockains heads ye Sign."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This portrait is of excessive rarity. Curiously enough, the copper-plate
was used as the portrait of Ovid in North's translation of Plutarch's
Lives, and it has also more than once been re-engraved. The
volume contains also two dramatic pieces, "The Obstinate Lady, a
Comedy written by Aston Cokain," which was first published in 1657,
and "Trappolin suppos'd a Prince, an Italian Trage-Comedy." Cokain
also wrote the "Tragedy of Ovid," and other things, and several
editions of his works, under different titles, were issued.</p>

<h2><small><i>THE MOST PLEASANT</i></small><br />

<i>Song of Lady Bessy</i>,<br />

<small><i>The Eldest Daughter of King Edward the Fourth,
and how she married King Henry the Seventh, of
the House of Lancaster.</i></small></h2>


<p>This fine old ballad concerning the Princess Elizabeth of York,
wife of Henry VII. of Lancaster, relates to the Earl of Derby,
the Earl of Shrewsbury, and others connected with Derbyshire.
It is supposed to have been written by Humphrey Brereton.
There are two versions of this curious ballad. The version here given
is from a MS. copy of the time of Charles II., belonging to the late
Mr. Bateman. It was edited by Mr. Halliwell for the Percy Society.</p>

<span class="i0">Oh! father Stanley, to you I call,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For the love of God remember thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since my father King Edward, that king royall,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At Westminster on his death bed lee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He called to him my unckle Richard,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So he did Robert of Brackenbury,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And James Terrill he was the third;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He sent them to Ludlow in the west countrey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fetch the Duke of York, and the Duke of Clarence,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">These two lords born of a high degree.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Duke of York should have been prince,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And king after my father free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a balle-full game was them among,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When they doomed these two lords to dye:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They had neither justice nor right, but had great wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Alack! it was the more pitty!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neither were they burried in St. Maries,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In church or churchyard or holy place;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! they had dolefull destinies,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hard was their chance, worse was their disgrace!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore, help good father Stanley, while you have space,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For the love of God and mild Mary,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else in time to come you shall, alas!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Remember the words of Lady Bessy!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good Lady Bessy, be content,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For tho' your words be never so sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If King Richard knew, you must be shent,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And perchance cast into prison deep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then had you cause to waill and weep,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>

<span class="i2">On a certain day in a study,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A book of reason he had in his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And so sore his study he did apply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That his tender tears fell on the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All men might see that stood him by:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There were both earls and lords of land,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But none of them durst speak but I.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I came before my father the king,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And kneeled down upon my knee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I desired him lowly of his blessing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And full soon he gave it unto me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in his arms he could me thring,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And set me in a window so high;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spake to me full sore weeping,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">These were the words he said to me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Daughter, as thou wilt have my blessing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Do as I shall councell thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to my words give good listening,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For one day they may pleasure thee:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here is a book of Reason, keep it well,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As you will have the love of me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neither to any creature do it tell,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Nor let no liveing lord it see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Except it be the Lord Stanley,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The which I love full heartiley:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the matter to him show you may,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For he and his thy help must be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As soon as the truth to him is shown<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Unto your words he will agree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For their shall never son of my body be gotten<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That shall be crowned after me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But you shall be queen and wear the crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So doth expresse the prophecye!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gave me tax and toland,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And also diamonds to my degree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To get me a prince when it pleaseth Christ,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The world is not as it will be:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore, good father Stanley, grant my request<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For the love of God I desire thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All is at your commandment down in the west,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Both knight and squire and the commentie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You may choose then where you like best,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I have enough both of gold and fee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I want nothing but the strength of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And good captains two or three.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go away, Bessy, the lord said then,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To this will I never agree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For women oft time cannot faine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">These words they be but vain glory!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For and I should treason begin<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Against King Richard his royalty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In every street within London<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
<span class="i2">The Eagle's foot should be pulled down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as yet in his great favour I am,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But then shoud I loose my great renowne!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shoud be called traitor thro' the same<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Full soon in every markett towne!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That were great shame to me and my name,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I had rather spend ten thousand pounde.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O father Stanley, to you I mak my moane,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For the love of God remember thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is not three days past and gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Since my unckle Richard sent after me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A batchelor and a bold baron,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A Doctor of Divinitye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bad that I should to his chamber gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His love and his leman that I should bee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the queen that was his wedded feere,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He would her poyson and putt away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So would he his son and his heir,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Christ knoweth he is a proper boy!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I had rather burn in a tunne<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On the Tower Hill that is so high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or that I would to his chamber come,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His love and his leman will I not be!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had rather be drawn with wild horses five,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through every street of that citty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or that good woman should lose her life,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Good father, for the love of mee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am his brother's daughter dear;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He is my uncle, it is no nay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or ever I would be his wedded feere,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
<span class="i2">With sharp swords I will me slay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At his bidding if I were then,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And follow'd also his cruel intent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I were well worthy to suffer pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And in a fire for to be brent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore, good father Stanley, some pity take<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On the Earl Richmond and me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the rather for my father's sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which gave thee the Ile of Man so free;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He crowned thee with a crown of lead,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He holpe the first to that degree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He set thee the crown upon thy head,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And made thee the lord of that countrey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That time you promised my father dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To be to him both true and just,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now you stand in a disweare,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh! Jesu Christ, who may men trust?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O good lady, I say againe<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Your fair words shall never move my mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King Richard is my lord and sov'raign,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To him I will never be unkind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will serve him truly till I die,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I will him take as I him find;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he hath given to mine and me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His bounteous gifts do me so bind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet good father Stanley, remember thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As I have said so shall it prove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he of his gift be soe free,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It is for fear and not for love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For if he may to his purpose come,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
<span class="i2">You shall not live these years three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For these words to me he did once move<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In Sandall Castle underneath a tree:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said there shall no branch of the eagle fly<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Within England, neither far nor nigh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor none of the Talbots to run him by,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor none of their lineage to the ninth degree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he would them either hang or head,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And that he swear full grievously.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore help, gentle lord with all speed;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For when you would fain it will not be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your brother dwellith in Holt Castle,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A noble knight forsooth is he;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the Welsh-men love him well,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He may make a great company.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sir John Savage is your sister's son.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He is well beloved within his shire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A great company with him will come,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He will be ready at your desire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gilbert Talbott is a captain pure,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He will come with main and might;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To you he will be fast and sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Against my uncle king and knight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us raise an host with him to fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Soon to the ground we shall him ding,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For God will stand ever with the right,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For he hath no right to be king!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go away, Bessy, the Lord can say;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of these words, Bessy, now lett be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know king Richard woud not me betray,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
<span class="i2">For all the gold in Christantye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am his subject, sworn to be true:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If I should seek treason to begin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I and all mine full sore should rue,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For we were as like to lose as winne.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside that, it were a deadly sin<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To refuse my king, and him betray:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The child is yet unborne that might moan in time,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And think upon that woefull day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherefore, good lady, I do you pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Keep all things close at your hart root;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So now farr past it is of the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To move me more it is no boot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then from her head she cast her attire,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her colour changed as pale as lead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her faxe that shoan as the gold wire<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She tair it of besides her head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in a swoon down can she swye,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She spake not of a certain space!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Lord had never so great pitty<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As when he saw her in that case,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in his arms he can her embrace;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He was full sorry then for her sake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tears fell from her eyes apace,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But at the last these words she spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said, to Christ my soul I betake,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For my body in Tem'ms drow'nd shall be!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I know my sorrow will never slake,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And my bones upon the sands shall lye!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fishes shall feed upon me their fill;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
<span class="i2">This is a dolefulle destinye!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you may remedy this and you will,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Therefore the bone of my death I give to thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ever she wept as she were woode,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Earle on her had so great pitty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That her tender heart turned his mood.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He said, stand up now, Lady Bessye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As you think best I will agree<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now I see the matter you do not faine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have thought in this matter as much as yee:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But it is hard to trust women,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For many a man is brought into great woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through telling to women his privity:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I trust you will not serve me so<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For all the gold in Christantie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No, father, he is my mortall foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On him fain wrooken woud I bee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hath put away my brethren two,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And I know he would do so by me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But my trust is in the Trinity,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through your help we shall bale to him bring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And such a day on him to see<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That he and his full sore shall rue!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Lady Bessye, the Lord can say,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Betwixt us both forecast we must<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How we shall letters to Richmond convey,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No man to write I dare well trust;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For if he list to be unjust<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And us betray to King Richard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then you and I are both lost;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Therefore of the scribe I am afraid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You shall not need none such to call,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Good father Stanley, hearken to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What my father, King Edward, that king royal,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Did for my sister, my Lady Wells, and me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sent for a scrivener to lusty London,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He was the best in that citty;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He taught us both to write and read full soon,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If it please you, full soon you shall see:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lauded be God, I had such speed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That I can write as well as he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And also indite and full well read,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And that (Lord) soon shall you see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both English and alsoe French,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And also Spanish, if you had need.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The earle said, You are a proper wench,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Almighty Jesus be your speed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And give us grace to proceed out,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That we may letters soon convey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In secrett wise and out of doubt<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To Richmond, that lyeth beyond the sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We must depart, lady, the earle said then;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wherefore keep this matter secretly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this same night, betwixt nine and ten,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In your chamber I think to be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look that you make all things ready,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Your maids shall not our councell hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I will bring no man with me<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But Humphrey Brereton, my true esquire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He took his leave of that lady fair,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
<span class="i2">And to her chamber she went full tight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for all things she did prepare,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Both pen and ink, and paper white.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lord unto his study went,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Forecasting with all his might<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bring to pass all his intent;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He took no rest till it was night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the stars shone fair and bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He him disguised in strange mannere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He went unknown of any wyght,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No more with him but his esquire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when he came her chamber near,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Full privily there can he stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cause the lady to appeare<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He made a signe with his right hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the lady there him wist,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She was as glad as she might be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Char-coals in chimneys there were cast,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Candles on sticks standing full high;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She opened the wickett and let him in,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And said, welcome, lord and knight soe free!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rich chair was set for him,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And another for that fair lady.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They ate the spice and drank the wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He had all things at his intent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They rested them as for a time,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And to their study then they went.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then that lady so fair and free,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With rudd as red as rose in May,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She kneeled down upon her knee,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
<span class="i2">And to the lord thus can she say:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good father Stanley, I you pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now here is no more but you and I;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me know what you will say,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">In Latham Castle there he doth lye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I parted with him his heart did change,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">That his formast finger out of the joint went:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hurt him sore, he did complain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">These words to him then I did say:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Son, on my blessing, turne home againe,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This shall be a token another day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bid him come like a merchant of Farnfield,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Bid him lodge in no common hall,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Commend me to my brother Sir William so dear,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>

<span class="i0">I bad him ride down into the North-West,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Perchance a knight in England I might him see:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherefore pray him at my request<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To come to London to speak with me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then said the royall Lord so just,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now you have written, and sealed have I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is no messenger that we may trust,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To bring these writeings into the West Countrey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because our matter it is so high,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Least any man wou'd us descry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Humphrey Brereton, then said Bessye,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hath been true to my father and me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shall take the writeings in hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And bring them into the West Countrey:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I trust him best of all this land<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On this message to go for me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go to thy bed, Father, and sleep full soon,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And I shall wake for you and me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By tomorrow at the riseing of the sune,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Humphrey Brereton shall be with thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She brings the Lord to his bed so trimly dight<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All that night where he should lye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Bessy waked all that night,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There came no sleep within her eye:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the morning when the day can spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Up riseth young Bessye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And maketh hast in her dressing;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To Humphrey Brereton gone is she:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when she came to Humphrey's bower bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With a small voice called she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Humphrey answered that lady bright,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Saith, Who calleth on me so early?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am King Edward's daughter right,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Countesse clear, young Bessy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all hast with mean and might<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou must come speak with the Earle of Darby.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Humphrey cast upon him a gowne,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And a pair of slippers upon his feet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! said Humphrey, I may not ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My horse is tired as you may see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since I came from London city,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Neither night nor day, I tell you plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There came no sleep within my eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On my business I thought certaine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay thee down, Humphrey, he said, and sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I will give space of hours three:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fresh horse I thee beehyte,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shall bring thee through the West Countrey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Humphrey slept not hours two,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But on his journey well thought hee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fresh horse was brought him tooe,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To bring him through the West Countrey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Humphrey Brereton with mickle might,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hard at Latham knocketh hee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is it, said the porter, this time of the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That so hastily calleth on mee?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The porter then in that state,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That time of the night riseth hee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forthwith opened me the gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And received both my horse and me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then said Humphrey Brereton, truely<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
<span class="i2">With the Lord Strange speak would I faine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his father the Earle of Darby.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then was I welcome that time certaine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A torch burned that same tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And other lights that he might see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brought him to the bedd side<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where as the Lord Strange lie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lord mused in that tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Said, Humphrey Brereton, what mak'st thou here?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How fareth my father, that noble lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In all England that hath no peer?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Humphrey took him a letter in hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And said, Behold, my lord, and you may see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the Lord Strange looked the letter upon,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The tears trickled downe from his eye:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, we must come under a cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We must never trusted bee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We may sigh and make a great moane,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This world is not as it will bee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have here, Humphrey, pounds three,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Better rewarded may thou bee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Commend me to my father dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His daily blessing he would give me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said also in that tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Tell him all thus from me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I be able to go or ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This appointment keep will I.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Humphrey received the gold, I say,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Straight to Manchester rideth hee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun was light up of the day,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>

<span class="i2">As they together their matins did say:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">My father's servant at command,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some hasty tydeings bringeth hee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He took them either a letter in hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And bad them behold, read and see:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They turn'd their backs shortly tho',<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And read those letters readily.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up they leap and laughed too,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And also they made game end glee,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair fare our father, that noble lord,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Strait to London rideth he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all the hast that he could wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His journey greatly he did apply.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when he came to London, as I weene,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It was but a little before the evening,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was he warr, walking in a garden,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Both the earle, and Richard the king.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the earle did Humphrey see,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When he came before the king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gave him a privy twink then with his eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then down falls Humphrey on his knees kneeling;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Welcome, Humphrey, says the lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I have missed thee weeks three.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have been in the west, my lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There born and bred was I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For to sport and play me certaine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Among my friends far and nigh.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell me, Humphrey, said the earle then,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How fareth all that same countrey?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the countreys I dare well say,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
<span class="i2">They be the flower of chivalry;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they will bycker with their bowes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They will fight and never fly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell me, Humphrey, I thee pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How fareth King Richard his commenty?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When King Richard heard him say so,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In his heart he was right merry;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He with his cap that was so dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He thanked that lord most courteously:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said, father Stanley, thou art to me near,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You are the chief of our poor commenty;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half England shall be thine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It shall be equall between thee and me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am thine and thou art mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So two fellows will we bee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I swear by Mary, that mild maiden,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I know no more such under the skye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I am king and wear the crown, then<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I will be chief of the poor commenty:<br /></span>

<span class="i2">In no countrey farr nor nigh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If their goods I shoud take and pluck them downe,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For me they woud fight full faintly:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is no riches to me so rich,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As is the love of our poor commenty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they had ended all their speeches,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They take their leave full heartiley;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to his bower King Richard is gone.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">When Bessy Humphrey did see anon,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Welcome, she said, Humphrey Brereton;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How hast thou spedd in the West Countrey<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I pray thee tell me quickly and anon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into a parlour they went from thence,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There were no more but he and shee:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Humphrey, said Bessy, tell me e're we go hence<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some tideings out of the West Countrey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I shall send for yonder prince<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To come over the sea, for the love of me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if King Richard shoud him convince,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Alas! it were great ruthe to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or murthered among the Stanley's blood to be,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Indeed that were great pitty;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sight on that prince I woud not see,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For all the gold in Christantie!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell me, Humphrey, I thee pray,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What answer of them thou had now say,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And what reward they gave to thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the third day of May it shall be seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In London all that they will bee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt in England be a queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or else doubtless that they will dye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus they proceed forth the winter then,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their councell they kept close all three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The earle he wrought by prophecy certaine,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In England and France well beloved is he.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Then came forth the Earle of Darby,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">These words he said to young Bessy:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, Bessye, thou art to blame<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To appoint any shipp upon the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have a good shipp of my owne,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shall carry Humphrey with the mules three;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An eagle shall be drawne upon the mast top,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That the Italians may it see;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">If any one ask whose ship it is, then<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Say it is the Earles of Darby.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Humphrey took the three mules then,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Into the west wind wou'd hee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without all doubt at Liverpoole<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He took shipping upon the sea:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a swift wind and a liart,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Where as the porter stood it by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And welcomed me full heartiley,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And received then my mules three;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall thee give in this breed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To thy reward pounds three;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Nor Humphrey none of the fee,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I will open thee the gates certaine<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To receive thee and the mules three;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a Cheshire man born am I certain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From the Malpas but miles three.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The porter opened the gates that time,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And received him and the mules three.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wine that was in the hall that time<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He gave to Humphrey Brereton truely.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! said Humphrey, how shoud I doe,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I am strayed in a strange countrey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Prince of England I do not know,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Before I never did him see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall thee tell, said the porter then,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Prince of England know shall ye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low where he siteth at the butts certaine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With other lords two or three;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">A little alsoe above the chinn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His face is white, his wart is redd,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No more than the head of a small pinn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You may know the prince certaine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As soon as you look upon him truely.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He received the wine of the porter, then<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With him he took the mules three.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Humphrey came before that prince<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He falleth downe upon his knee,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He delivereth the letters which Bessy sent,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And so did he the mules three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rich ring with a stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thereof the prince glad was hee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He took the ring of Humphrey then,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And kissed the ring times three.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Humphrey kneeled still as any stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As sure as I do tell to thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Humphrey of the prince answer gott none,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Therefore in heart was he heavy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Humphrey stood up then full of skill,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And then to the prince said he:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why standest thou so still at thy will,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And no answer dost give to me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am come from the Stanleys' blood so dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">King of England for to make thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fairer lady then thou shalt have to thy fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There is not one in all christantye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She is a countesse, a king's daughter, Humphrey said,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The name of her it is Bessye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She can write, and she can read,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Well can she work by prophecy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I may be called a lewd messenger,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For answer of thee I can gett none,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I may sail home with heavy cheare,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What shall I say when I come home?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prince he took the Lord Lee,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the Earle of Oxford was him nee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Lord Ferris wou'd not him beguile truely,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To councell they are gone all three;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
<span class="i0">When they had their councell taken,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To Humphrey then turned he:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Answer, Humphrey, I can give none truely<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Within the space of weeks three;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mules into a stable were taken anon,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The saddle skirts unopened were,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therein he found gold great plenty<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For to wage a company.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He caused the abbot to make him chear:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In my stead now let him be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I be king and wear the crown<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Well acquited Abbott shalt thou be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Early in the morning they made them knowne,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As soon as the light they cou'd see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With him he taketh his lords three,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And straight to Paris he took his way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An herriott of arms they made ready,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of men and money they cou'd him pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shipps to bring him over the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Stanleys' blood for me hath sent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King of England for to make me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And I thank them for their intent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For if ever in England I wear the crowne,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Well accquited the King of France shall be:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then answered the King of France anon,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Men nor money he getteth none of me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor no shipps to bring him over the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In England if he wear the crowne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then will he claim them for his own truely:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With this answer departed the prince anon,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And so departed the same tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the English lords three<br /></span>

<span class="i2">There as Humphrey Brereton then lee;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">If every hair were a man,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With thee, sir prince, will I be:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Humphrey Brereton his leave hath tane,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And sailed forth upon the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight to London he rideth then,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There as the earle and Bessy lay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bad them behold, read and see.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The earle took leave of Richard the king,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">He left Bessye in Leicester then<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To keep King Richard company.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sir William Stanley made anone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ten thousand coats readily,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which were as redd as any blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereon the hart's head was set full high,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Edward Stanley had three hundred men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There were no better in Christantye;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sir Rees ap Thomas, a knight of Wales certain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eight thousand spears brought he.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sir William Stanley sat in the Holt Castle,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Which way standeth the wind, can any tell?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I pray you, my men, look and see.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The wind it standeth south east,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So said a knight that stood him by.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This night yonder prince, truely<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into England entereth hee.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He called a gentleman that stood him nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His name was Rowland of Warburton,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He bad him go to Shrewsbury that night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bid yonder prince come inn:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But when Rowland came to Shrewsbury,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The portculles was let downe;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They called him Henry Tydder, in scorn truely,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said, in England he shou'd wear no crowne;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rowland bethought him of a wyle then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tied a writeing to a stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And threw the writeing over the wall certain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bad the bailiffs to look it upon:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They opened the gates on every side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And met the prince with procession;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And wou'd not in Shrewsbury there abide,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But straight he drest him to Stafford towne.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">King Richard heard then of his comeing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He called his lords of great renowne;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Lord Pearcy he came to the king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And upon his knees he falleth downe,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I have thirty thousand fighting men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For to keep the crown with thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Duke of Northfolk came to the king anone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And downe he falleth upon his knee;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Earle of Surrey, that was his heir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were both in one company;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We have either twenty thousand men here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For to keep the crown with thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Lord Latimer, and the Lord Lovell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Earle of Kent he stood him by,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Lord Ross, and the Lord Scrope, I you tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They were all in one company;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Bishopp of Durham, he was not away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sir William Bonner he stood him by,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The good Sir William of Harrington, as I say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said, he wou'd fight and never fly.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">King Richard made a messenger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sent him into the west countrey,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And bid the Earle of Darby make him bowne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bring twenty thousand men unto me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or else the Lord Strange his head I will him send,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And doubtless his son shall dye;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For hitherto his father I took for my friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now he hath deceived me.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Another herald appeared then<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To Sir William Stanley that doughty knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bid him bring to me ten thousand men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else to death he shall be dight.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then answered that doughty knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spake to the herald without letting;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Say, upon Bosseworth Field I meen to fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uppon Monday early in the morning;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Such a breakfast I him behight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As never did knight to any king.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The messenger home can him gett,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tell King Richard this tydeing.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fast together his hands then cou'd he ding,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said, the Lord Strange shou'd surely dye;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And putt him into the Tower of London,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For at liberty he shou'd not bee.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lett us leave Richard and his lords full of pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And talk we more of the Stanleys' blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That brought Richmond over the sea with wind and tyde,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Litle Brittain into England over the flood.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now is Earle Richmond into Stafford come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sir William Stanley to Litle Stoone;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The prince had rather then all the gold in Christantye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have Sir William Stanley to look upon;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A messenger was made ready anone,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And there he kissed him times three;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The welfare of thy body doth comfort me more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then all the gold in Christantye.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then answered that royall knight there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the prince these words spake he,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Remember, man, both night and day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who doth now the most for thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In England thou shalt wear a crown, I say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else doubtless I will dye;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A fairer lady then thou shalt have for thy feer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was there never in Christanty;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She is a countesse, a king's daughter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there to both wise and witty;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I must this night to Stone, my soveraigne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For to comfort my company.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The prince he took him by the hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said, farewell, Sir William, fair and free.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now is word come to Sir William Stanley there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Early in the Monday, in the morning,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That the Earle of Darby, his brother dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had given battle to Richard the king.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That wou'd I not, said Sir William anone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all the gold in Christantye,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That the battle shou'd be done;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight to Lichfield cou'd he ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In all the hast that might bee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when he came to Lichfield that tyde,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All they cryed King Henry:<br /></span>

<span class="i2">In all the hast that might be,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But when he came Bolesworth Field unto,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There met a royall company;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Earle of Darby thither was come,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And twenty thousand stood him by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sir John Savage, his sister's son,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sir Rees ap Thomas he was thereby,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With ten thousand spears of mighty tree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Earle of Richmond went to the Earle of Darby,<br /></span>

<h2><i>Devonshire's Noble Duel</i><br />

<small><i>WITH LORD DANBY IN THE YEAR</i> 1687.</small></h2>


<p>Of this curious ballad, which is also known by the name of
"The Long Armed Duke," there are several versions. The
one here given is printed from a broad-sheet, and is, perhaps,
the most complete of any of the versions which has come under my
notice. The circumstance which gave rise to the ballad has not as yet
been satisfactorily explained. It has been suggested that its origin was
the quarrel in which the Earl of Devonshire, Lord Delamere, and
Colonel Colepepper were engaged. It is traditionally said that the
arms of the "Long Armed Duke" were so long that he could garter
his stockings below the knee without stooping down or being seated!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Good people give attention to a story you shall hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between the King and my Lord Delamere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A quarrel arose in the Parliament House,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Concerning the Taxes to be put in force.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I wonder, I wonder, that James our good King,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So many hard Taxes upon the poor should bring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So many hard Taxes, as I have heard them say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes many a good farmer to break and run away.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Such a rout has been in the Parliament, as I hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt a Dutch lord and my Lord Delamere.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said to the King, as he sat on the throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"If it please you, my Liege, to grant me a boon."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, what is thy boon? Come let me understand."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"'Tis to give me all the poor you have in the land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll take them down to Cheshire, and there I will sow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both hemp seed and flax seed, and hang them in a row.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It's better, my Liege, they should die a shorter death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than for your Majesty to starve them on earth."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With that up starts a Dutch Lord, as we hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he says, "Thou proud Jack," to my Lord Delamere,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thou ought to be stabbed," and he turned him about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For affronting the King in the Parliament House."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then up got a brave Duke, the Duke of Devonshire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who said, "I will fight for my Lord Delamere:&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He is under age, as I'll make it appear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I'll stand in defence of my Lord Delamere."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stage then was built, and to battle they went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To kill or be killed it was their intent.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The very first blow, as we understand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Devonshire's rapier went back to his hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he mus&eacute;d awhile, but not a word spoke<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
<span class="i0">When against the King's armour his rapier he broke.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, then he stept backward, and backward stept he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then stept forward my Lord Willoughby;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gave him a rapier, and thus he did say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Play low, Devonshire, there's treachery, I see."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He knelt on his knee, and he gave him the wound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With that the Dutch Lord fell dead on the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King call'd his soldiers, and thus he did say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Call Devonshire down, take the dead man away."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He answered, "My Liege, I've killed him like a man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it is my intent to see what clothing he's got on.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O treachery! O treachery! as I well may say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was your intent, O King, to take my life away.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He fought in <i>your</i> armour, while I fought him bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou, King, shalt win it before thou dost it wear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I neither do curse King, Parliament, or Throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I wish every honest man may enjoy his own.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The rich men do flourish with silver and gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While poor men are starving with hunger and cold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if they hold on as they have begun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They'll make little England pay dear for a King."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another version, which I have in MS., has, besides many minor
variations, these additional verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh the Duchess of Devonshire was standing hard by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon her dear husband she cast her lovely eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh, fie upon treachery&mdash;there's been treachery, I say,&mdash;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
<span class="i0">It was your full intent to have ta'en my Duke's life away."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then away to the Parliament these votes all went again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there they acted like just and honest men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I neither curse my King, nor kingdom, crown or throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I wish every honest man to enjoy but what is his own.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One of the versions of this ballad gives the name of Lord Delaware&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In the Parliament House a great rout has been there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt our good King and the Lord Delaware."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And it also gives the locality for sowing "hemp seed and flax seed" to
"Lincolnshire." This same version speaks of the Duke of Devonshire
as&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Up sprung a Welch Lord, the brave Duke of Devonshire."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There can be no doubt, however, that Lord Delamere is the peer
intended to be commemorated, and that Cheshire is the county to
which he is made to refer, and to which indeed he belonged.</p>

Fair, it may be well to remark, is still the most popular fair in the
Midland Counties, and is annually attended by many of the "Lasses
of Darby," who "with young men" go "to Goose-fair for recreation,"
by special trains and otherwise. The distance of Nottingham from
Derby by turnpike road, along which the lasses and young men of the
ballad must have travelled, is fifteen miles. Goose-fair formerly lasted
for twenty-one days.</p>

<h2><i>The Humours of Hayfield Fair.</i></h2>


<p>This ballad, copied from a broad-sheet, has been printed in
Hutchinson's "Tour through the High Peak of Derbyshire,"
1809. It will be seen to be a version&mdash;whether the original
one or not remains to be seen&mdash;of the favourite ballad usually called
"Come Lasses and Lads," of which the earliest known copy appears
to have been printed in 1672, under the title of "The Rural Dance
about the May-pole," and which has again been printed in "Pills to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
purge Melancholy," in "Tixhall poetry," and also, with the music, in
Chappel's "Popular Music of the Olden Time," as well as in several
other works. It ought to be stated that the ballad I here reprint&mdash;"The
Humours of Hayfield Fair,"&mdash;although I speak of it as a version
of the "Rural Dance about the May-pole," is, with the exception of
here and there a verse, or part of a verse, totally distinct from it. It
will, of course, be seen to go to the same tune. Hayfield is a village
near Chapel-en-le-Frith, in the High Peak of Derbyshire,&mdash;in the midst

<h2><i>The Drunken Butcher of Tideswell.</i></h2>


<p>Tideswell is one of the largest and most important villages
in the High Peak of Derbyshire, and has been more than
once, as will be seen in the present volume, celebrated in song
and ballad. It is situated about seven miles from Buxton, and the same
from Bakewell, in a highly romantic and wildly picturesque neighbourhood.
Its church is a fine building, containing many interesting monuments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
among which are those to the Foljambes, Meverells, &amp;c., and
one to Bishop Pursglove. The following ballad is the production of
William Bennett, the author of "The King of the Peak," "The
Cavalier," etc. Of this ballad Mr. Bennett thus spoke in the "Reliquary,"
in which it appeared:&mdash;"The ballad (the subject of which is as
well known in the Peak as that Kinder Scout is the highest hill, and
Tideswell Church the most stately and beautiful church in it) will
perhaps appear a little modernised to some, who have only heard the
tale from the mouths of unsober topers, accustomed to use ancient
provincial and obsolete words, which not only render the sense less
distinguishable, but also mar the flow of the rhythm. I confess, therefore,
to having taken some liberties with the grammar, the orthography,
and the metre; but in all other respects I have strictly adhered to the
original; and my honesty in this respect will be recognized and admitted
by many persons to whom these minstrel relics are precious.</p>

<p>"The legend is still so strong in the Peak, that numbers of the inhabitants
do not concur in the sensible interpretation put upon the
<i>appearance</i> by the Butcher's wife, but pertinaciously believe that the
drunken man was beset by an evil spirit, which either ran by his horse's
side, or rolled on the ground before him, faster than his horse could
gallop, from Peak Forest to the sacred inclosure of Tideswell churchyard,
where it disappeared; and many a bold fellow, on a moonlight
night, looks anxiously around as he crosses Tideswell Moor, and gives
his nag an additional touch of the spur, as he hears the bell of Tideswell
Church swinging midnight to the winds, and remembers the tale
of the 'Drunken Butcher of Tideswell.'"</p>

<h2><i>A New Ballad of Robin Hood:</i><br />

<small><i>Shewing his Birth, Breeding, Valour and Marriage,
at Titbury Bull-running: Calculated for the Meridian
of Staffordshire but may serve for Derbyshire
or Kent.</i></small></h2>


<p>There are no series of ballads in our language so extensive or
so popular as those relating to the noble outlaw, Robin
Hood, and his "merry doings" in Sherwood Forest and
its neighbourhood. Some of these relate immediately to Derbyshire;
and many others might, from their allusions and the persons named
in them, be claimed by that county. Some of his exploits are related
to have been performed in Derbyshire; numerous places in that county
are named after him; some of the relatives of his family resided within
its confines; and last, though not least, his faithful friend and follower,
<i>Little John</i>, is said not only to have been one of the sons of its soil,
but to have died and been buried in the place of his birth.</p>

<p>That Robin Hood was a real and veritable personage seems to have
been satisfactorily settled by the late Rev. Joseph Hunter, who discovered
among the state papers some records wherein, besides the
name being correctly given as "Robyn Hood," showed that that
personage was in the King's service, and that he left it to travel;&mdash;doubtless
into his favourite haunts in Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, and
Derbyshire. Among the entries relating to Robin Hood, Mr. Hunter
gleaned several which tallied curiously and conclusively with the
circumstances of his early life as given in the "Lytell Geste of Robyn
Hode," printed about the year 1489, by Wynken de Worde.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The ballad which I here give, showing "his birth, breeding, valour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
and marriage at Titbury Bull-running," I give from a curious old broad-sheet
in my own collection. It is printed broad-way on the paper, and
has a rude wood-cut of Robin Hood with his buckler and quarter staff,
and Clorinda,&mdash;another name for Maid Marian,&mdash;with a tall hat, or
like the Welsh fashion, and a bow in her hand, the entrance to the
church in the back-ground. It bears the imprint, "Northampton:
Printed by R. Raikes and W. Dicey." A black-letter copy is in the
Roxburgh Collection in the British Museum, and it has also been reprinted
by Evans and by Gutch. The ballad is "supposed to be
related by the fiddler who played at their wedding."</p>

<h2><i>Robin Hood and Little John.</i></h2>


<p>Little John, the friend and sturdy companion of Robin
Hood, was made almost as popular in ballads as his noble
master. He is said to have been a man of immense size, and
of almost unequalled prowess and strength. His name of <i>Little</i> John
was, it appears, given to him ironically, because of his extraordinary
stature. He is believed to have been born at Hathersage, in the Peak
of Derbyshire; a place not many miles distant from Loxley Chase,
where Robin Hood first drew breath. The place of his birth is, however,
claimed by other localities. The ballad I here give is interesting,
as detailing his first meeting and encounter with Robin Hood, which
ended in the defeat of the outlaw, and in their becoming sworn friends
for life.</p>

<p>It will be seen that in the ballad Little John is said to have been
seven feet in height. This, curiously enough, accords with the tradition
current in Hathersage, where his bones were exhumed some years ago,
and where his grave is still shown.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When Robin Hood was about twenty years old,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He happened to meet Little John,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A jolly brisk blade, right fit for the trade,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For he was a lusty young man.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tho' he was call'd little, his limbs they were large,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And his stature was seven foot high:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where ever he came, they quak'd at his name,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
<span class="i2">For soon he would make them to fly.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How they came acquainted I'll tell you in brief,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If you would but listen awhile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this very jest, among all the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I think, may cause you to smile.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For Robin Hood said to his jolly bowmen,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pray tarry you here in this grove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And see that you all observe well my call,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While thorough the forest I rove.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We have had no sport these fourteen long days,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now should I be beat, and cannot retreat,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My horn I will presently blow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then did he shake hands with his merry men all,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And bid them at present good-bye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then as near a brook his journey he took,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A stranger he chanc'd to espy.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They happen'd to meet on a long narrow bridge,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">I'll shew you right Nottingham play.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With that from his quiver an arrow he drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A broad arrow with a goose wing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stranger replied, I'll liquor thy hide,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If thou offer to touch the string.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth bold Robin Hood, thou dost prate like an ass,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For, were I to bend but my bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could send a dart quite through thy proud heart,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Before thou could'st strike me one blow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou talk'st like a coward, the stranger replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Well arm'd with a long bow you stand,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Have nought but a staff in my hand.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The name of a coward, quoth Robin, I scorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Therefore my long bow I'll lay by;<br /></span>

<h2><i>Little John's End.</i></h2>


<p>The current tradition in Derbyshire concerning Little John is
that he was born at Hathersage, in that county; that he was
a man of immense stature, and of wonderful strength and
prowess; that he was withal of mild and gentle temperament, of affectionate
disposition, and faithful in his attachments; that after the death
of Robin Hood at Kirklees, which he took deeply to heart, he was so
dispirited that he sank under the loss, and having by great exertion
succeeded in reaching the place of his birth, (Hathersage,) he was
welcomed by his friends and old associates, who begged him to tarry
with them for the rest of his life; that he had just strength enough left
to point out the place in the churchyard where he wished to be buried,
and to give them instructions for his burial; that he told them in three
days he should die, and desired that his bow and cap should be hung
up in the church; that on the third day he died, in a small cottage still
standing, where, it is said, his length was so great when dead and "laid
out," that his feet came outside the door; that he was buried where he
had directed, his cap and bow being hung in the chancel of the church;
that the people drave his last arrow into the ground near his grave, and
that it took root and grew up into a tree. It is asserted that until within
the last sixty or seventy years, his cap&mdash;a green cloth one&mdash;still hung
high in the chancel, but was then taken away by some people from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Yorkshire, who also despoiled his grave, and took away the thigh
bones, which were found to be of immense length. The grave, which
is marked by two small upright stones, one at the head and the other at
the foot, measures about ten feet in length. In 1728 it was opened,
and bones of an enormous
size found in it. Some years
ago it was again opened,
and a thigh bone measuring
thirty-two inches taken away
from it.</p>

<p>In reference to this tradition
it will no doubt be
interesting to give the accompanying
fac-simile of the
writing of Elias Ashmole,
copied from his MSS. at
Oxford, (who was born in
1617,) and who there says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Little John lyes buried
in Hatherseech Church yard
within 3 miles fro Castleton
in High Peake with one
Stone set up at his head and
another at his Feete, but a
large distance betweene them.
They say a part of his bow
hangs up in the said Church
Neere Grindleford Bridge are
Robin Hoods 2 Pricks."</p></blockquote>

<p>The following ballad,

tradition, was written by Mr.

in "The Reliquary,"
vol. II., page 11. Several
other ballads relating to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Little John might well be given in this volume, but the two I have
selected&mdash;his first acquaintance with Robin Hood, and his death and
burial&mdash;will be sufficient to show their character. The others must be
deferred for a future work.</p>

<h2><i>The Lay of the Buckstone.</i></h2>


<p>The following excellent ballad has been collected from the <i>disjecta
membra</i> of the forest minstrelsy of the High Peak, and
arranged in its present form, by my friend Mr. William
Bennett, of Chapel-en-le-Frith. Mr. Bennett considers, and with good
reason, that it has originally formed two distinct ballads, one relating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
to a contention and fight between Robin Hood and the keepers of Peak
Forest, and the other to a match with the long-bow between him and
the Foresters. This ballad has been printed in "The Reliquary," vol.
I., page 101.</p>

<h2><i>Sir Richard Whittington's Advancement:</i><br />

<small><i>Being an Historical Account of his Education, Unexpected
Fortune, Charity, &amp;c.</i></small></h2>


<p>The rhyme and the story of "Whittington and his Cat" are
perhaps as well known as any ballads in the language. Sir
Richard Whittington, or "Dick Whittington," as he is
commonly called, was of the same family as the De Whittingtons,
Lords of Whittington, near Chesterfield, Derbyshire. He was, it is
stated, youngest son of a Sir William Whittington. In 1393, when he
must have been about forty years of age, he became a member of the
Mercers' Company, and was, it is said, besides being a Mercer, a
Merchant Adventurer. He was also about this year an Alderman, and
also Sheriff, of London. In 1397 he was appointed Lord Mayor of
London, by writ from Richard II., to serve in place of the deceased
Lord Mayor. In 1398, in 1406, and again in 1419, he was elected to
and served the office of Lord Mayor. Whittington married Alice,
daughter of Sir Hugh Fitzwarren and Maude his wife. He died in
1423. Besides being "<i>thrice Lord Mayor of London</i>," his body was,
it seems, <i>thrice</i> buried in the church he had himself erected,&mdash;St.
Michael Paternoster: first, by his executors, who erected a monument
over his remains; secondly, in the reign of Edward VI.,
when the minister, thinking that probably some great riches had
been buried with him, had his body taken up and despoiled
of its leaden covering; and, thirdly, in the reign of Mary, when the
parishioners were compelled to again take him up, re-enclose him in
lead, and re-erect the monument over his remains. At the great fire
of London, in 1666, both church and monument were destroyed. His
memory has been well preserved in the popular mind by ballad and
story and tradition; and his noble charities and his munificent acts, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
which so many evidences remain in London, form a prouder and more
enduring monument than the one which the fire destroyed.</p>

<p>The following version of the ballad is perhaps the one most generally
known:&mdash;</p>

<h2><i>Tideswell in an Uproar,</i><br />

<small><i>Or the Prince in the Town, and the Devil in the
Church.</i></small></h2>


<p>One Sunday in 1806 the Prince of Wales, afterwards George
IV., passed through Tideswell, in the High Peak, and
stopped to change horses at the principal inn of the place.
The circumstance caused, as was only natural, considerable excitement
in the place, which culminated in not only the whole of the congregation
of the parish church, but also the clergyman himself, and his clerk,
forsaking the service to see him pass. This circumstance gave rise
to much merriment, and more than one ballad was the result. The
following is the best:&mdash;</p>

<h2><i>The Derby Ram.</i></h2>


<p>The origin of this popular old ballad has yet to be ascertained.
At present it has puzzled more heads than one, and its
elucidation must be left to future research. Its principal
characteristic is its bold extravagance. Derby and Derby people have,
however, I know by references to allusions to it, been fond of their
Ram for more than a century. How much older it is than that time
is difficult to say. There are several versions of the ballad: the one I
here give is, however, the most complete I have met with. The
"Derby Ram" has been set as a glee by Dr. Callcott, and is still sung
with much applause at public dinners in the town. So popular, indeed,
is the Ram in the district, that a few years ago&mdash;in 1855&mdash;the
First Regiment of Derbyshire Militia, whose barracks and head quarters
are at Derby, carrying out the idea of the Welsh Fusileers with their
goat, attached a fine Ram to the staff of the regiment. So well trained
was he, and so evidently proud of his post, that he marched with a
stately step in front of the band as they marched day by day through
the town while up for training, and attracted quite as much notice as
any drum-major ever did. More than this, a political periodical, a
kind of provincial <i>Charivarri</i>, has been issued under the title of the
"Derby Ram," which is supposed to butt at party doings, and at local
abuses of various kinds; and I write this note with a steel pen which
bears the extraordinary name stamped upon it of the "Derby Ram
pen!"</p>

<h2><i>The Blink-Ey'd Cobler.</i></h2>


<p>The plot of the ballad of "The Blink Eyed Cobler," is the old
story of a young gentleman falling in love with a servant,
seducing her, promising to marry her, the marriage prevented
by the "cruel father," a disguise adopted, the father giving a dowry
to the supposed Cobbler so as to induce him to marry her, and in
the end the happy reconciliation of all the parties. The ballad is
here given from a broad-sheet in my own collection. It is printed
broad-way of the paper, in four columns, and has a wood-cut at the
head, of a lady and her waiting-woman before a looking-glass, and a
gentleman standing in the room with them. It occurs also in other
forms.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All you that delight in merriment,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>

<span class="i0">It is very new and certain true,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You need not tarry long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before you laugh your belly full,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Therefore be pleas'd to stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hope that you will be pleased,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Before you go away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It's of a knight in Derbyshire,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who had a handsome son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He kept a handsome chambermaid,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who had his favour won;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They dearly lov'd each other,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Being full of sport and play,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Having seduced this "handsome chambermaid," and she having told
him that she is likely to become a mother, the ballad goes on&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He cries love be contented,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(This is what must be said,)<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The old man stood in the corner,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He paid the girl her wages,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Next morning unto London,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Along with a sturdy guide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his uncle's house on Cornhill,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He sent him to abide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as they rode along the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He said unto the guide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll give thee twenty guineas<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And he went to his sweetheart Sue,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And what he design'd to do.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disguis'd like a poor cobler,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With a long rusty beard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a leather coat not worth a groat,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To his father's house he steer'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knocked boldly at the door,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
<span class="i2">And when his father came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, sir, be you such a one?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He answered, yes, the same,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">As we do understand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old man strutted boldly,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then took her by the hand,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">This fifty pounds I give.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The old man home he went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bride and bridegroom rode away,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To London by consent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where she was fairly brought to bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With joy and much content,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A letter into the country,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To his father then he sent,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For beauty, wit, and good manners,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beyond all riches be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So here's a good health to the cobler,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With another to handsome Sue,<br /></span>

<p>Cook Laurel, or Cock Lorel, as he is variously called, was
a notorious rogue in the thirteenth or fourteenth century, and
is not unfrequently alluded to by the old writers. Lorel, or
Laurel, was a word signifying a rascal,&mdash;a bad, low, worthless fellow;
and <i>Cock</i> Lorel would therefore denote an arch-rogue, a very prince of
rascals! <i>Lorel's den</i> was a place of resort, no doubt, for thieves and
sharpers, and "lazy lorel," which is an expression even now not unfrequently
heard, means an idle, worthless fellow. A curious little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
tract, entitled "Cocke Lorrell's Bote," was printed by Wynken de
Worde; and this "Cock Lorel's Boat" is mentioned in a MS. poem
of <i>Doctor Double Ale</i>, in the Bodleian Library, and in other writings.
In it persons of various classes, including the minstrels, are summoned
to go on board his ship of Fools. In Rowland's "Martin Markhall,
his Defence and Answer to the Bellman of London" (1610), Cock
Lorrell stands second only in the list of rogues there given, and is thus
described: "After him succeded, by the generall council, one Cock
Lorrell, the most notorious knave that ever lived. By trade he was a
tinker, often carrying a pan and hammer for show; but when he came
to a good booty he would cast his profession in a ditch, and play the
padder."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The ballad of Cock Lorrell is introduced in Ben Jonson's masque of
the "Gipsies Metamorphosed," and in "Pills to purge Melancholy."
The copy I here give I have copied from the original broad-sheet in
the Roxburghe Collection in the British Museum. It is in some parts
exceedingly coarse in its wording, and is therefore unfit to be given
entire. It will be seen that Cock Lorrell, the prince of rogues,
invites his Satanic Majesty to Castleton, in the High Peak of Derbyshire,
to dinner, and the dishes served up for the occasion are people of
various disreputable callings and hypocritical habits, against whom the
shafts of the writer are levelled.</p>

<p>The broad-sheet from which the ballad is here copied, is printed in
black letter, and has an engraving of the banquet at the head. It is
"Licensed and entered according to order. London: Printed by and
for W. O. and A. M. ...to be sold by J. Deacon, at the Angel in
Guiltspur Street." It begins:&mdash;</p>

<p>This ballad I print from a MS. copy of full fifty years old, in
my own collection. I am not aware that it has ever before
been printed. To another copy in the Bateman Collection,
(which differs in the wording, though not in the sense, in many places,
and in which the sixth verse is wanting,) is appended this note: "The
Tailor's name was Eyre, and this curious exploit was performed on the
19th January, 1797."</p>

<h2><i>Squire Vernon's Fox-Chace.</i></h2>


<p>This ballad, one of the most popular of our hunting songs,
relates to the noble old Derbyshire family of Vernon, in
olden times of Haddon Hall, but for several generations of
Sudbury Hall, in the same county, which family is now represented by
the Right Hon. Lord Vernon, whose seat Sudbury Hall is. "Squire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Vernon," of this ballad, was George Vernon, an ancestor of Lord
Vernon, and was, like his namesake and ancestor of old, George Vernon
of Haddon, (father of the celebrated Dorothy Vernon,) who acquired
and deserved the name of the "King of the Peak," remarkably fond of
hunting, and kept a capital pack of hounds. The copy I here give I
print from a very scarce broad-sheet in my own collection. It is in
two columns, with two curious little wood-cuts at the head.</p>

<h2><i>The Trusley Hunting Song.</i></h2>


<p>This interesting ballad, which has been more than once printed,
recounts the events of a famous day's "sport,"&mdash;a run with
the hounds,&mdash;at Trusley, in Derbyshire; Trusley Hall being
one of the seats of the Coke family for many generations. The ballad
was written by Tom Handford, a blacksmith at Trusley, who also
acted in the capacity of "Whipper-in" to "Squire Coke," who was
the last William Coke of Trusley, and who died in 1716. A portrait of
Tom Handford was painted by order of Squire Coke, and hung up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
the servants' hall at Trusley, with this inscription, written by Mr.
Coke&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">He was both Smith and Poet!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A version of this ballad, preserved in MS. by the late D'Ewes Coke,
Esq., was furnished to me by that gentleman. It differs in many
essential points from the one I now print, both in the names as well as
in the construction of the stanzas. The different versions of this and
other ballads have doubtless arisen from their having been written
down from memory; and the different singers would also, probably,
take some little license in altering the words to suit their own particular
tastes. I prefer giving the <i>printed</i> version, which is evidently the
original one. My copy, which I here give, was "Printed by W. O.
in Leadenhall Street," and is of an almost contemporaneous period
with the song itself. It is printed broadway on the sheet, in four
columns, and has at the head of the first two columns a rude engraving
of two huntsmen galloping past a tree, and following a stag and a
couple of hounds. It is headed "<i>Princely Diversion: or The Jovial
Hunting-Match</i>."</p>

<p>Trusley is a village and parish nearly seven miles from Derby, and
about midway between Radbourne and Longford, a seat of the Coke
family.</p>

<h2><i>Squire Frith's Hunting Song.</i></h2>


<p>Another good old Derbyshire hunting song is the following,
which relates to a celebrated run with the hounds of "Squire
Frith, of Bank Hall," near Chapel-en-le-Frith, in the High
Peak. Mr. Samuel Frith was a keen sportsman, and for more than
fifty years was one of the most daring and best hunters in the district&mdash;one
of the roughest and most awkward that could be found anywhere.
With regard to the run celebrated in this song, it appears that one
December morning, some eighty or ninety years ago, in a keen frost,
Mr. Frith turned out his own pack of harriers at Castle Naze Rocks, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
the moors near his residence. To the surprise of the Squire, instead of
a hare putting off, a fine fox broke covert, and made away to the Moors.
The dogs got away after him, and Mr. Frith and his huntsman, Jack
Owen, followed over some of the most tremendous ground even of
Derbyshire. The fox made off across the moors, skirting Axe-edge,&mdash;the
highest mountain in the Peak,&mdash;to Macclesfield forest; thence by
Langley and Gracely woods to Swithingley. From thence he went by
Housley and Gawsworth, and at length, after a run of more than forty
miles, was killed at Clouds Hill, near Congleton, Mr. Frith and his
huntsman being up at the time. Mr. Frith rode a favourite black cob
of his called "Black Jack," one of the best fencers in the county,&mdash;a
quality of essential importance in that district of stone walls and rocks.
Bank Hall is about two and a half miles from Chapel-en-le-Frith.</p>

<h2><i>An Elegy</i><br />

<small><i>Upon the Death of all the greatest Gentry in Darley-Dalle,
who loved Hunting and Hawking, and
several other Games. The Poet's view, well
known to you, to be too true, and so adieu, by
me LEO. W.</i> 1672.</small></h2>


<p>The following extremely curious poem, containing many interesting
allusions to families long since departed, was written
in 1672, by Leonard Wheatcroft, some time clerk of the
parish, poet, tailor, and schoolmaster, at Ashover, in Derbyshire. He
was a man of talent, and wrote many things which are worth collecting
together. It is here printed from the original MS. The last verse
was evidently added after the accession of George the First.</p>

<p>The title of the ballad is particularly quaint, and characteristic of the
man and of the county of which he was a native. In the dialect of the
district the rhymes would be perfect, and would read thus:&mdash;</p>

<h2><i>Cocktail Reel.</i></h2>


<p>The "Merriment" recounted in this singular ballad, which I
am not aware has ever before been printed, is said to have
taken place at Dronfield, in Derbyshire, and I have heard the
sixth line sung as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"From Chesterfield, Beighton, and Masber."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is, however, uncertain whether this is correct, or whether it may not
more probably have taken place at Rotherham, which is near both
Kimberworth, Brightside, and Masber (Masborough). The copy I here
give is from a MS. of more than half a century old.</p>

<i>Sent as a Present from Sir William St. Quintin, to
His Grace the Duke of Devonshire, at Bath, on
Christmas-Day,</i> 1762. <i>Written by Mr. Derrick.</i></small></h2>


<p>This curious effusion of Samuel Derrick's, who was Master of
the Ceremonies at Bath at the time, I here reprint from a
slip broad-sheet of the period in my own collection. The
peer to whom this famous Yorkshire pie was sent, was William, fourth
Duke of Devonshire, who died in 1764. Sir William St. Quintin,
Bart., of Harpham, in the county of York, who died in 1771, was
Member of Parliament for Thirsk, and High Sheriff in 1733. He
married Rebecca, daughter of Sir John Thompson, Lord Mayor of
London, and by her was father of the last baronet of the name of St.
Quintin.</p>

<h2><small><i>THE</i></small><br />

<i>Complainte of Anthonie Babington.</i></h2>


<p>The following deeply interesting "complaynt" was written by
Richard Williams, and dedicated, in MS., to King James
the First. It remained unpublished until 1862, when it was
communicated to "The Reliquary" by Mr. W. Durrant Cooper,
F.S.A. Anthony Babington was born in 1561, and on the death of
his father, succeeded to the family estates at Dethick, in Derbyshire,
which had been acquired by the Babingtons through marriage with the
heiress of Dethick. He was executed, along with thirteen others, under
circumstances of peculiar barbarity, on the 20th of September, 1586,
for a conspiracy to liberate the truly unfortunate and much to be commiserated
Mary Queen of Scots. His petition to Queen Elizabeth is
simple and touching in the extreme, and the heart must indeed have
been callous to good and womanly feeling that could withstand it and
spurn its prayer. It is as follows:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Most gratious Souvarigne yf either bitter teares a pensisve contrite
harte ore any dutyfull sighte of the wretched Synner might work any
pitty in your royall brest, I would wringe out of my drayned eyes as
much bloode as in bemoaninge my drery tragedye shold, lamentably
bewayll my faulte, and somewhat (no dought) move you to compassion,
but synnce there is no proportione betwixte the qualitye of my crimes
and any human commiseration, Showe sweet Queene some mirakle on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
a wretch that lyethe prostrate in yr prison, most grivously bewaylinge
his offence and imploringe such comforte at your anoynted hande as my
poore wives misfortunes doth begge, my childe innocence doth crave,
my gyltless family doth wishe, and my heynous trecherye dothe leaste
deserve, So shall your divine mersy make your glorye shyne as far
above all princes, as my most horrible practices are more detestable
amongst your beste subiectes, whom lovinglye and happielye to
governe.</p>

<p>"I humbly beseche the mercye Master himself to grante for his sweete
Sonnes sake, Jesus Christe."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>My dreade and royall sovereigne,</p>

<p>This <span class="smcap">Anthonie Babington</span> was borne at a mansion house
of his father called Dethicke in the Countie of Darbye in
the parishe of Critche; whose father was a man of good
accompte and lived well and orderlie in his contrie, kept a
good house, and releived the poore. But he was inclined
to papistrie as the times then required; who had a brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
that was doctor of divinitie in queene Maryes dayes, of
whome some mention is made in this storye. This Anthonye,
the son, was a yonge man, well featured, and of
good proportion in all the lyneamentes of his bodie, of a
most pregnante fyne witt and great capacitie, had a watchinge
head, ande a moste proude aspiringe mynde; and by
nature a papist, whereinn hee was borne and brought upp;
where if he had bene trayned otherwise hee might have
proved a good member of the common wealthe, where nowe
be became a reproche and scandall to the same.</p>

<p>In whose course of life many accidents hapned even from
his birthe to his deathe as appeares in this his complainte
wherein I have followed the methode of a booke intituled,
the "Mirrour of Magistrates" wherein everye man semes to
complayne of his owne misfortunes, humbly beseeching
your royall maiestie to pardon all defectes as well in my
writinge as in the baseness of the verses. In the one I
have done as well as my learninge did serve me, for the
other as well as my olde eyes woulde permitt me,
which I beseech your royall Maiestie to censure with
clemencye, and I will trulye praise to the almightie for the
long continuance of your healthe and happie Estate bothe
to Godes glorye and your Maiesties comforte.</p>

<h2><small><i>A NEW SONG IN PRAISE OF</i></small><br />

<i>The Derbyshire Militia.</i></h2>


<p>This song is of the period from 1780 to 1790, and is here
given from a broad-sheet in my own collection. It is the
only copy I have as yet met with. At the head of the song
is a wood-cut of three soldiers seated round a table, smoking. On the
table is a punch-bowl and glasses. On the same sheet is "<i>The Pressed
Man's Lamentation</i>," a song of four verses, beginning, "Farewell our
Daddies and our Mammies." At the head is a wood-cut of two ships
at sea, one of which has struck on a rock.</p>

<h2><i>The Florist's Song.</i></h2>


<p>The Florists' Society of Derby flourished in the latter part of
last century. Its meetings were held at the Angel Inn, in
the Corn-market; and it held exhibitions, at which prizes
were awarded. The following song was sung at the convivial meetings
of its members, and is here reprinted from a broad-sheet in my own
possession.</p>

<h2><small><i>THE SORROWFUL LAMENTATION, LAST DYING SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF</i></small><br />

<i>Old Nun's Green,</i><br />

<small><i>Who after upwards of</i> 460 <i>Years (being a great and
good Gift, by JOHN of GAUNT, Duke of Lancaster,
and Earl of Leicester) was tried, cast and
condemned, on the</i> 14<i>th of February,</i> 1791, <i>for
being serviceable to the Poor People of this Town,
as well as a Stranger, but a great Eye Sore to
some particular Gentlemen; but the Execution is
left till the Pleasure of Parliament be known.</i></small></h2>


<p>Nun's Green was a large piece of ground, containing about
fifty acres of land, in the town of Derby, on which the
inhabitants of the borough had right of common. On this
common many encroachments were made by persons digging for
gravel, erecting small buildings, etc.; and in 1768 an act was passed
for selling a portion of the Green, so as to erect dwelling-houses for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
the increasing population of the town, and for the removal of nuisances
and encroachments.</p>

<p>In 1791 the remaining portion of the Green was determined to be
sold for the like purpose, and application for the necessary powers
was made to Parliament, the scheme being that the proceeds should
in part, at all events, go towards defraying the cost of paving and
lighting, and otherwise improving, the town of Derby. This movement
provoked the utmost opposition, and I have in my own collection
some thirty or forty, at least, different hand-bills, squibs, pamphlets,
and songs to which the excitement gave birth. Despite the opposition
and the petitions which were got up, Nun's Green was disposed of,
and the tract of land is now covered with thickly inhabited streets.
The following pieces will serve to show the style of the songs and
ballads to which I have alluded. The first, which is printed in two
columns, has a wood-cut, at its head, of a man being led to execution in
a cart, with hangman, parson, javelin-men, and others around&mdash;</p>


<h3><i>A TRAVELLER'S DREAM.</i></h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Last Night as slumbering on my Bed I lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good People pray now mind but what I say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought as I was walking over cross Nun's Green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the fairest Goddess that was ever seen:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her Head reclining o'er the purling Stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At first I thought this could not be a Dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I ask'd her Name, and weeping thus said she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I once was call'd, that Jewel <span class="smcap">Liberty</span>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I ask'd her, why she in that Posture lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She rais'd Her head, and softly thus did say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With broken Accents and with flowing Tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I have liv'd here, Four Hundred and Sixty Years;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was station'd here by Glorious <span class="smcap">John</span> of <span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Who never thought the poor should ever want,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now I'm doom'd to die a cruel Death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Gentlemen, who never knew my Birth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because I gave Assistance to the Poor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oft times kept the Wolf, Sir, from the Door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because I'll not be sold the Streets to light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That is the Reason, Sir they owe me spite;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If Gentlemen could only once agree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They need not hang nor sell poor <span class="smcap">Liberty</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But let me live as I was first design'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be a Comfort to the poorest Kind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' I'm the smallest of that Family,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm not the only Child of <span class="smcap">Liberty</span>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you will tamely stand and see me die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You'll soon repent the Loss of <span class="smcap">Liberty</span>:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My other Sisters soon, must fall a Prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To those who falsely take my Life away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now Tyranny does put the Town in Fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Don't wonder why I drop this melting Tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tread on a Worm, that Insect cannot bite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But turns in Anguish to revenge its Spite:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So let them know such Usage you'll not brook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst such a Man does live as <span class="smcap">Parker Coke</span>;"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At this I shouted, but found it a Joke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Dream it was, so instantly awoke.<br /></span>

<h2><i>Lost and Dead.</i></h2>


<p>In the parish register of Chapel-en-le-Frith is the sad entry of
the burial of a child which was found dead in the neighbourhood&mdash;"S.
Sept. 20, 1656. A poor child found dead in y<sup>e</sup>

founded on this circumstance. It has not before been printed.</p>

<span class="i0">And soon the gude wife on the ample board<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Through brake and copse of the forest drear<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He turned away down a mossy dell,<br /></span>

<h2><i>Sir Francis Leke;</i><br />

<small><i>OR THE POWER OF LOVE.</i><br />

<i>A Derbyshire Catholic Legend of Cromwell's time.</i></small></h2>


<p>The Lekes, or Leakes, of Sutton-in-Scarsdale, Derbyshire, derived
their descent from Alan de Leka, of Leak in Nottinghamshire,
who was living in 1141. The first of the family
who settled at Sutton was William, a younger son of Sir John Leke of
Gotham, in the early part of the fifteenth century; and the manor was
acquired by a marriage with the heiress of the Hilarys, who took the
name of Gray, and who inherited it from Robert de Hareston, Lord of
Sutton. Sir Francis Leake, the fourth in descent from William above-named,
married a co-heiress of Swift, and was succeeded by his son
Francis, who in 1611 was created a baronet. In 1642 he was created
Lord Deincourt of Sutton, and in 1645, Earl of Scarsdale. These
titles became, however, extinct in 1736, by the death of Nicholas, the
fourth Earl, and the last of the family. His lordship took an active
part in the Civil Wars; and Lysons, speaking of him, says in 1643, (the
beginning of April) "Lord Deincourt began to fortify his house at
Sutton. Sir John Gell sent his brother, Colonel Thomas Gell, with
five hundred men and three pieces of ordnance to besiege it. Lord
Deincourt was summoned, but refused to surrender, and for some time
obstinately defended himself. The house was taken, and Lord Deincourt
and his men made prisoners. The works were demolished, and
Lord Deincourt set at liberty, on giving his word that he would
repair to Derby within eight days and submit himself to the Parliament.
Sir John Gell observes that the forfeiture of his word on this occasion
was revenged by the garrison at Bolsover, who some time afterwards,
when that castle was in the hands of the Parliament, plundered Lord
Deincourt's house at Sutton. In 1645 Lord Deincourt was created
Earl of Scarsdale. Having rendered himself very obnoxious to the
Parliament by his exertions in the royal cause during the Civil War, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
estates were sequestered, and, as he refused to compound, they were
sold. His son procured some friends to be the purchasers, he paying
the sum of &pound;18,000, fixed by the Parliamentary Commissioners as the
composition." His lordship felt so deeply the execution of his royal
master, Charles the First, that he clothed himself in sackcloth, and,
causing his grave to be dug some years before his death, laid himself
in it, it is said, every Friday for divine meditation and prayer.</p>

<p>The following ballad, embodying a tradition concerning Sir Francis
Leke, is by Richard Howitt, one of the "worthies" of Derbyshire, of
which county I am proud to say he is a native.</p>

<h2><i>The True Lover's Knot Untied:</i><br />

<small><i>Being the right path whereby to advise princely Virgins
how to behave themselves, by the example of the renowned
Princess the Lady Arabella, and the second
son of the Lord Seymour, late Earl of Hertford.</i></small></h2>


<p>The beautiful, much-injured, and ill-fated Lady Arabella of this
touching ballad, whose sole crime was that she was born a
Stuart, was the daughter of Elizabeth Cavendish of Chatsworth,
in Derbyshire, by her husband Charles Stuart, Earl of Lennox,
who was brother to Lord Darnley, the husband of the unfortunate
Mary Queen of Scots. She was grand-daughter of Sir William Cavendish
of Chatsworth, and of his wife, the celebrated "Bess of Hardwick,"
afterwards Countess of Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>The incidents of the life of this young, beautiful, and accomplished
lady, which form one of the most touching episodes in our history,&mdash;the
jealous eye with which Elizabeth looked upon her from her birth,&mdash;the
careful watch set over her by Cecil,&mdash;the trials of Raleigh and his
friends,&mdash;her troubles with her aunt (Mary, Countess of Shrewsbury),&mdash;her
being placed under restraint,&mdash;her marriage with Seymour,&mdash;her
seizure, imprisonment, sufferings, and death as a hopeless lunatic in
the Tower of London, where she had been thrown by her cousin,
James the First,&mdash;are all matters of history, and invest her life with a
sad and melancholy interest.</p>

<p>As the autograph signature of this ill-starred but lovely and exemplary
young lady is but little known, I append a fac-simile,</p>

<p>which no doubt will add to the interest of the following ballad. The
ballad was sung to the tune of "The Frog Galliard."</p>

<h2><i>An Address to "Dickie."</i></h2>


<p>At a farm-house at Tunstead, near Chapel-en-le-Frith, a human
skull, about which hangs many a strange story, has for several
generations&mdash;indeed "time out of mind"&mdash;been preserved.
There are some curious traditions connected with this skull, which is
popularly known as "Dickie," or "Dicky o' Tunsted." How it first
came to the farm is a complete mystery. All that is known is that it
has been there for many generations, and always occupies the same
position in the window-seat of the house. No matter what changes
take place in the other occupiers of the house, Dicky holds his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
against all comers, and remains quietly ensconced in his favourite
place. It is firmly and persistently believed that so long as Dick
remains in the house, unburied, everything will go on well and
prosperously, but that if he is buried, or "discommoded," unpleasant
consequences will assuredly follow. On more than one occasion he has
been put "out of sight," but tempests have arisen and injured the
building, deaths have ensued, cattle have been diseased and died off, or
crops have failed, until the people have been humbled, and restored
him to his proper place. One of the crowning triumphs of Dickie's
power is said to have been evinced over the formation of the new
Buxton and Whaley Bridge line of railway. He seems to have held
the project in thorough hatred, and let no opportunity pass of doing
damage. Whenever there was a land slip or a sinking, or whenever
any mishap to man, beast, or line happened, the credit was at once
given to Dickie, and he was sought to be propitiated in a variety
of ways.</p>

<p>Hutchinson, who wrote "A Tour through the High Peak" in 1807,
thus speaks of the skull, and of the supernatural powers attributed to
it:&mdash;"Having heard a singular account of a human skull being preserved
in a house at Tunstead, near the above place, and which was
said to be haunted, curiosity induced me to deviate a little, for the
purpose of making some enquiries respecting these <i>natural</i> or <i>super</i>natural
appearances. That there are three parts of a human skull in
the house is certain, and which I traced to have remained on the
premises for near two centuries past, during all the revolutions of
owners and tenants in that time. As to the truth of the supernatural
appearance, it is not my design either to affirm or contradict, though I
have been informed by a creditable person, a Mr. Adam Fox, who was
brought up in the house, that he has not only repeatedly heard singular
noises, and observed very singular circumstances, but can produce fifty
persons, within the parish, who have seen an apparition at this place.
He has often found the doors opening to his hand&mdash;the servants have
been repeatedly called up in the morning&mdash;many good offices have been
done by the apparition, at different times;&mdash;and, in fact, it is looked
upon more as a guardian spirit than a terror to the family, never disturbing
them but in case of an approaching death of a relation or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
neighbour, and showing its resentment only when spoken of with
disrespect, or when its own awful memorial of mortality is removed.
For twice within the memory of man the skull has been taken from the
premises,&mdash;once on building the present house on the site of the old
one, and another time when it was buried in Chapel churchyard;&mdash;but
there was no peace! no rest! it must be replaced! Venerable time
carries a report that one of two coheiresses residing here was murdered,
and declared, in her last moments, that her bones should remain on the
place for ever.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> On this head the candid reader will think for himself;
my duty is only faithfully to relate what I have been told. However,
the circumstance of the skull being traced to have remained on the
premises during the changes of different tenants and purchasers for near
two centuries, must be a subject well worth the antiquarian's research,
and often more than the investigation of a bust or a coin!"</p>

Samuel Laycock, and first appeared in the <i>Buxton Advertiser</i>.</p>

<h2><i>The Driving of the Deer.</i></h2>


<p>This admirable ballad, founded on an old Derbyshire tradition,
is by my friend Mr. William Bennett, of whom I have before
spoken. The Peverels were, as a part of the immense possessions
given to them by William the Conqueror, owners of the tract
of country comprising the Honour and Forest of the High Peak.
Their stronghold was the castle at Castleton. The "Lord's seat"
mentioned in the ballad is a mountain separating Rushop Edge from
the valley of Edale. The view from here, where Peverel used to
alight from his horse to watch the progress of the chace, says Mr.
Bennett, "is magnificent; perhaps one of the finest in north Derbyshire,
as from its summit you may see the Pennine chain of Cheshire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
Derbyshire, and Staffordshire, with many of the lovely valleys which
lie among the hills. Westward, you look down upon the valley of
Chapel-en-le-Frith, the eastern part of which contains the ancient
manor of Bowdon. To realize the following ballad, my readers must
imagine the Lord of the Peak, William Peverel, with a number of his
knights and gentlemen, on the Lord's Seat, preparing for the chace,
when they hear the bugle blast which informs the proud baron that
some audacious sportsmen are in chase of the deer within his forest.
We may picture to ourselves the astonishment and indignation of the
Norman prince, and his fierce determination to pounce upon the trespassers
and punish them with all the severity of the cruel forest law.
Well was it for all parties that he was attended by his brother Payne
Peverel, the lord of Whittington, who was one of the noblest sons of
chivalry, and whose presence prevented an affray which in all probability
would have been fatal to many. Payne Peverel had previous to
this time exhibited a grand pageant at Castleton, accompanied by a
tournament held in the meadows below the castle, when he gave away
his daughter to the knight who most distinguished himself on that

<h2><i>The Ashupton Garland,</i><br />

<hr />
<p class="center">To a pleasant Northern Tune.</p>
<hr />

<p>Ashopton is a small village, but little known away from
its own neighbourhood, in the vale of the river Ashop,
in the chapelry of Derwent, in the High Peak. This very
clever ballad was written on occasion of what was evidently an extremely
happy pic-nic party, held there not many years ago. It is one
of the best modern ballads I have seen.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Then some came East, and some came West,<br /></span>

<h2><i>Derbyshire Hills.</i></h2>


<p>James Bannard, "a Wandering Poet, in his 74th year,"
is the writer of the following lines, which he says at the
heading of the broad-sheet from which I reprint it, are "Views
and reflections taken from Solomon's Temple, near Buxton." Of
Bannard I know nothing, farther than that he was a poor man, and
eked out his living by selling these verses "at the 'Cottage of Content,'
Buxton."</p>

<h2><small><i>ON THE DEATH OF THE LATE</i></small><br />

<i>Rev. Bache Thornhill, M.A.,</i><br />

<small><i>Perpetual Curate of Winster, Ashford, and Longstone.</i></small></h2>


<p>Mr. Thornhill, on whose death through accident the
following verses were written, was son of Bache Thornhill,
Esq., of Stanton in the Peak. He was a man of refined
tastes, fond of antiquarian pursuits, and was highly esteemed in the
county of Derby. He was M.A. of St. John's College, Cambridge,
where he was a fellow-student with Sir Robert Peel, with whom to the
period of his untimely death he kept up an intimate friendship. On
the 13th of December, 1827, Mr. Thornhill was accidentally shot by
the discharge of the fowling-piece of a friend. He lingered until the
27th, when he died, at the age of forty-two. He was buried at Youlgreave,
the coffin bearing the inscription&mdash;"Rev. Bache Thornhill,
Vicar of Winster, and Vice-Vicar of Ashford and Longstone, died the
27th day of December, 1827; aged forty-two."</p>

<p>The writer of these verses was John Brimlow, of Winster. Brimlow
had been a soldier in Colonel Thornhill's regiment, under which gallant
officer he served in Egypt. He afterwards suffered from opthalmia,
became blind, and got a precarious livelihood by rambling about the
country with a basket, gathering "rags and bones." The verses are
here reprinted from a broad-sheet.</p>

<h2><i>A Journey into the Peak.</i><br />

<small><i>TO SIR ASTON COKAINE.</i></small></h2>


<p>Charles Cotton, the "honoured friend" of good old
Izaac Walton, and of most of the celebrated men of his day,
was born at Beresford Hall, on the banks of his</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"&mdash;&mdash;beloved Nymph! fair Dove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Princess of Rivers,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>whose praises he has sung, and whose beauties he has rendered immortal
by his pen, and by his fishing-house, dedicated to lovers of the
angle. He was the only child of Charles Cotton, Esq., by Olive,
daughter of Sir John Stanhope, of Elvaston Castle, near Derby (ancestor
of the Earl of Harrington, and of the same family as the Earl of
Chesterfield, Earl Stanhope, &amp;c.) He married, first, Isabella, daughter
of Sir Thomas Hutchinson, of Owthorpe; and, second, the widowed
Countess of Ardglass (daughter of Sir William Russel, of Strensham).
He died in 1687.</p>

<p>Charles Cotton was a profuse writer. Among his principal works
are the second part of "The Complete Angler," "The Wonders of
the Peak," "Virgil Travestie," "Moral Philosophy of the Stoics,"
"The Planter's Manual," "Life of the Duke of Espernon," "The
Commentaries of De Montluc," "The Complete Gamester," "The
Fair One of Tunis," "Burlesque upon Burlesque," "Montaigne's
Essays," &amp;c., &amp;c. After his death, a collection of "Poems on several
Occasions," by Charles Cotton, was published.</p>

<p>The following characteristic lines I here print from the original MS.
copy, in my own possession. The volume of manuscript is of the
highest interest, and is in the autograph writing of Charles Cotton himself.
It is entitled, in his own writing, "Charles Cotton, His Verses,"
and is in folio, in the old binding with clasps. This volume is described
in Sir Harris Nicholas' Life of Cotton, attached to his edition of the
Complete Angler. It contains some pieces not printed, and others very
different from those in his "Poems on Several Occasions," printed surreptitiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
after his death in 1689. The following varies in many parts
from the copy printed in the volume alluded to.</p>

<h2><i>Hugh Stenson and Molly Green.</i></h2>


<p>The following ballad has not, as far as I am aware, been "in
print" before. I here give it from a MS. copy in my own
possession. The Duke of Devonshire alluded to in the ballad
as having acted so nobly in saving the life of "his countryman," Hugh
Stenson, was, I presume, William, fourth Duke of Devonshire, who
was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1756.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<h2><i>The Beggar's Ramble.</i></h2>


<p>There are at least three or four different versions of the
"Ramble;" or rather I should say there are at least three
or four different metrical "Rambles" through Derbyshire, of
this character. I give two. The first I reprint from a broad-sheet, and
the second from an old MS. copy, both in my own collection. The
allusions to places, persons, inns, &amp;c., in the county, are curious and
interesting.</p>

<h2><i>Henry and Clara.</i><br />

<small><i>A PEAK BALLAD.</i></small></h2>


<p>In the middle of last century as brutal and cold-blooded a
murder as ever disgraced the annals of this kingdom was
perpetrated in the Winnats (a corruption of "wind gates")
at Castleton, the victims being a young gentleman and lady of "gentle,"
if not of "noble," blood, on their wedding-day, and the murderers
being five miners of the place. The following ballad, the production,
in his early days, of my late brother, the Rev. Arthur George Jewitt,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
was printed by him in his "<i>Wanderings of Memory</i>," in 1815. The
following explanatory note appears in "<i>Wanderings of Memory</i>:"&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the year 1768,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> a young gentleman and lady, each mounted on
a fine horse, but unattended by any servants, had been up to the
Chapel of Peak Forest to be married, (as being extra-parochial, the
Vicar at that time exercised the same privilege as the parson of Gretna
Green, and married any couple that came to him, without making any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
impertinent enquiries concerning them,) and on their return, wishing to
take Castleton in their way home, and being strangers in the country,
found themselves benighted at the Winnats." "Here they were seized
by five miners, dragged into a barn, robbed of a great sum of money,
and then murdered. In vain the lady sought them to spare her husband;
vainly he strove to defend his wife. While one part of them
were employed in cutting the gentleman's throat, another of the villains,
stepping behind the lady, struck a pick-axe into her head, which instantly
killed her. Their horses were found, some days after, with
their saddles and bridles still on them, in that great waste called Peak
Forest; and Eldon Hole was examined for their riders, but without
effect. They were then taken to Chatsworth, (the Duke of Devonshire
being Lord of the Manor,) and ran there as '<i>waifs</i>,' but never were
claimed, and it is said the saddles are yet preserved there. This
murder, thus perpetrated in silence, though committed by so large a
company, remained a secret till the death of the last of the murderers;
but Heaven, ever watchful to punish such horrid wretches, rendered
the fate of all the five singularly awful. One, named Nicholas Cock,
fell down one of the Winnats, and was killed on the spot. John Bradshaw,
another of the murderers, was crushed to death by a stone which
fell upon him near the place where the poor victims were buried. A
third, named Thomas Hall, became a suicide; a fourth, Francis Butler,
after many attempts to destroy himself, died raging mad; and the fifth,
after experiencing all the torments of remorse and despair which an ill-spent
life can inflict on a sinner's death-bed, could not expire till he
had disclosed the particulars of the horrid deed."</p>

<h2><i>The Gipsies' Song.</i></h2>


<p>For the following curious old Derbyshire song I am indebted to
my good friend James Orchard Halliwell, F.S.A. It occurs
in Playford's "Musical Companion," printed in 1673, and
has not, so far as I am aware, been reprinted till now. "Honest John
Playford," who was a printer as well as clerk of the Temple Church,
London, published several of the most famous music-books of his day,
and which at the present time are of the most service of any in determining
the dates and names of tunes to which the old ballads, &amp;c.,
were sung. In 1651 he published "A Musical Banquet, in three
books, consisting of Lessons for the Lyra Viol, Allmains, and Sarabands,
choice Catches and Rounds, &amp;c.;" and again with the title,
"A Banquet of Musick, set forth in three several varieties of Musick:
first, Lessons for the Lyra Violl; the second, Ayres and Jiggs for the
Violin; the third, Rounds and Catches: all which are fitted to the
capacity of young practitioners in Music." Among his many other
publications, his most famous was "The English Dancing Master, or
Plaine and Easie Rules for the Dancing of Country Dances, with the
Tune to each Dance," which passed through many editions, with
additional tunes, &amp;c. The "Musical Companion" was first published
in 1673, and from this edition the following "Gipsies Song" and
music are taken. The work contained two hundred and eighteen
compositions, of which one hundred and forty-three were catches and
rounds, and the remainder glees, airs, part-songs, &amp;c. This work was
highly popular, and between the years 1673 and 1730 it passed through
ten editions.</p>

<p>The "Gipsies' Song" here given was for two voices, and was composed
by Robert Johnson.</p>

<small><i>AND THE POUND OF TEA.</i></small></h2>


<p>The following ballad, recounting the droll mistake made by a
woman at Spondon, near Derby, who thought <i>green</i> tea was
to be boiled as <i>greens</i>, and eaten accordingly as "cabbage
and bacon," was printed in the "spirit of English wit," in 1809. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
tells its own tale. It may be well to remark that flax was, some years
ago, much grown in this part of Derbyshire: some meadows at Duffield
through which the turnpike road passes, are still known by the name
of <i>Flax-holmes</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<h2><i>The Ashborne Foot-Ball Song.</i></h2>


<p>On page 118 I have spoken of the game of foot-ball as played
at Derby. Ashborne was also one of the strongholds of this
manly game, and in that pleasant little town it has been
played from time immemorial, until "put down" by the strong arm of
the law&mdash;not without much unpleasantness and strenuous opposition&mdash;a
few years ago. The following song was sung (and I believe written)
by Mr. Fawcett, the comedian, at the Ashborne theatre, on the 26th
of February, 1821.</p>

<span class="i0">Where coaches are rolling by day and by night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in playing at Foot-Ball the people delight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where health and good humour does always abound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hospitality's cup flows freely around,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Like the French at the Battle of Waterloo run.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And well may they run like the devil to pay,<br /></span>

<h2><i>The Parsons Torr.</i></h2>


<p>The following admirable ballad, the production of the Rev.
W. R. Bell, formerly curate of Bakewell, is founded partly
on <i>facts</i>, and partly on <i>local traditions</i>. The unfortunate hero
of the story was the Rev. Robert Lomas, Incumbent of Monyash, who
was found dead, as described in the ballad, on the 12th of October,
1776. The scene of the ballad comprises the towns of Bakewell and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
Monyash, and the mountainous country between them, the western part
of which&mdash;that bordering on Lathkiln and Harlow Dales&mdash;being one of
the most romantic districts of the Peak. The ballad first appeared in
the "Reliquary," in 1864.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Parson of Monyash, late one eve,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sat in his old oak arm-chair;<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What was it that made that kind-hearted man<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Or, say&mdash;a glimpse of his own?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Black dark was that night and stormy withal,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It rained as 'twould rain a sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And round and within the old Parsonage house<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The wind moaned piteously.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still sat he deep musing till midnight hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And then in a waking dream&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He quailed to hear mid the tempest a crash,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And eke a wild piercing scream.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O mercy! cried he, with faltering breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What sounds are these which I hear?<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Good Lord, be thou to us near!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No longer sat he in that old arm-chair,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As the dark hours of night passed slowly on,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Loud shrieking for help in vain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He woke up at once with a sudden shock,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Old Hugh brought his horse to the garden gate,<br /></span>

<p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> "Titbury day:" the day on which the "Minstrels' Court," with
its "Bull-running," and other wild amusements, was held. The Minstrels
Court at Tutbury, to which all minstrels living in the counties of
Stafford and Derby did service, was presided over by a "King of the
Minstrels," who was selected yearly by the four stewards, two of whom
were chosen from the minstrels of Derbyshire, and the other two from
those of Staffordshire. The court was held before the Stewards of the
honour of Tutbury, on the morrow after the Assumption. A deed of
"John of Gaunt, King of Castile and Leon, Duke of Lancaster," dated
in the fourth of Richard II., confers certain powers on the "King of
the Minstrels in our honour of Tutbury," and speaks of service and
homage which even then had been performed by the Minstrels "from
ancient times." By a later instrument it was ordered "that no person
shall use or exercise the art and science of music within the said
counties, as a common musician or minstrel, for benefit and gains,
except he have served and been brought up in the same art and science
by the space of seven years, and be allowed and admitted so to do at
the said court by the jury thereof," under certain fines; that he shall
not teach or instruct any one for a less time than seven years; and that
he shall, under pain of forfeit, appear yearly at the "Minstrels' Court."
On the day of holding the court,&mdash;"Tutbury Day," as it is called in
the ballad,&mdash;all the minstrels within the honour came to the Bailiff of
the Manor and proceeded in procession to the parish church, the
"King" walking between the Bailiff of the Manor and the Steward of
the Minstrel's Court, and attended by his own four stewards, bearing
white wands. From church they proceeded in the same order to the
Castle hall, where the "King" took his seat, with the Bailiff and
steward on either side. The court was then opened by proclamation
ordering that every minstrel dwelling within the honour of Tutbury,
either in the counties of Derby, Stafford, Nottingham, Warwick, or
Lancaster, should draw near and give his attendance, and that all pleas
would be heard, and fines and amercements made. The musicians
having been called over by court roll, two juries were empanelled and
charged. The jurors then proceeded to the selection of officers for the
ensuing year. The jurors having left the court for the purpose, the
King and Stewards partook of a banquet, while the musicians played
their best on their respective instruments. On the return of the Jurors
they presented the new King whom they had chosen from the four
Stewards, upon which the old King, rising, delivered to him his wand
of office, and drank a cup of wine to his health and prosperity. In
like manner the old Stewards saluted, and resigned their offices to
their successors. This ended, the court rose, and adjourned to a
general banquet, in another part of the castle. The sports of the day
then commenced by a wild and infuriated bull being turned loose for
the minstrels to catch. The bull was thus prepared: his horns were
sawed off close to the head; his tail cut off to the stump; his ears
cropped; his body rubbed all over with grease; and his nostrils, to
madden him still further, blown full of pepper. While these preparations
were being made, the Steward made proclamation that all manner
of persons should give way to the bull, no person coming nearer to it
than forty feet, except the minstrels, but that all should attend to their
own safety, every one at his peril. The bull being then turned out, was
to be caught by some one of the minstrels, and no one else, between
that hour and sunset on the same day, within the county of Stafford.
If he escaped, he remained the property of the person who gave it
(formerly the Prior of Tutbury); but if any of the minstrels could lay
hold of him so as to cut off a portion of his hair and bring it to the
Market Cross, he was caught and taken to the Bailiff, by whom he
was fastened with a rope, &amp;c., and then brought to the bull-ring in the
High Street, where he was baited by dogs. After this, the minstrels
could either sell him or divide him amongst themselves. This custom
appears to have prevailed from 1377 to 1778, when it was very properly
discontinued. The day was one of feasting, revelry, and great excitement,
for the whole district.</p></div>
